This repository will be used to track the development plan of a test application for a contract interview.
The brief is basic and detailed as follows:

1.  Commit your code to GIT throughout and send the resulting GitHub/BitBucket repository details for review

2.  Write an application that outputs the individual words that appear in the book, and how many times that word appears in the text file.

3.  The second part is to also output whether the number of times each word appears is a prime number.

 
The following assumptions can be made:
-  Ignore punctuation and capitalisation

-  It would be beneficial to come up with more than one solution and be able to talk about the pro’s and con’s to each

-  The code should be C# compile and run on a machine with VS2013 and NUnit


In order to satisfy the brief I plan to split the devlopment into stages, creating small testable pieces of code along the way, and commit them with a stage readme.txt that describes what was trying to be achieved.

The stages are planned as follows (but these might change!)...

1.	Push up a basic console application with Nunit framework with key interfaces and classes I plan to use.
2.	Create tests, interfaces, and classes for the two text file parsing routines I intend to include.  One using a regular expression the 		other a split for each approach.
3.	Explore two ways of deciding if the resulting count of words is a prime.
4.	Create a couple of possible output scenarios and test.
5.	If there is time I may glam up the UI from console to something more fancy.

Although no set time is detailed for the task I have set myself a target of around three hours.
